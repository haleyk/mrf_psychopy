# eyetracking example

This example is provided so that you can look at how eyetracking was implemented.
Even with an eyetracker, it is unlikely that this script will run for you -- there are lots of monitor specifications that are bound not to match.

`latset.py` contains the overall script (how to run instructions, trial loops, etc.)
`supportFunctions.py` contains all the re-used functions, like running a single trial.

please excuse any poor coding, this was my first task ever written in psychopy and was never cleaned out.
