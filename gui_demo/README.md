# GUI example - face task

This example is a simple task that opens a window and shows the subject faces to categorize.
It was written entirely using the GUI and took ~20 minutes total.
This example should run on your machine if you open `face_cat.psyexp` after downloading standalone psychopy.
However, note that it might look weird / the text might get cut off since it was built for my specific monitor.

The data files it generates are the standard ones (I changed nothing nor set these parameters), but you can see they are thorough.

You can also run this task by just running `python face_cat_lastrun.py` which is a file generated entirely by the GUI.
This assumes your installation of python has psychopy and dependencies installed.
Definitely take a look at it after playing with the GUI - it generates highly commented code!
