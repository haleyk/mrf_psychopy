# syntax basics

`basic.py` should be used as an example of how I might build up a script, from beginning to end.
It is not intended to do anything particularly exciting, but shows how to present stimuli, record responses, and save data.

I would recommend reading through it and throwing exceptions after each block to do them one by one.
If you choose to run it on it's own, once the dogs and shapes show up press 1 or 2 to "respond" or press k to kill.
